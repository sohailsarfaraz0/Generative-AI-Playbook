# 🤖 Generative AI Playbook

A collection of **hands-on tutorials and notebooks** covering Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).  
This repo demonstrates **real-world use cases** of fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic workflows, and prompt engineering.  

## ✨ Features
- Fine-tuning Hugging Face Transformers on custom datasets  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain + vector databases  
- Prompt engineering & evaluation techniques  
- Agentic AI workflows for decision-making  
- Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility  

## 📂 Structure
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for each tutorial  
- `/datasets`: Example datasets for NLP tasks  
- `/models`: Trained/finetuned models  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI API  

## 🌍 Impact
This playbook serves as a **reference hub** for engineers, researchers, and practitioners globally who want to **bridge theory and practice in Generative AI**.
